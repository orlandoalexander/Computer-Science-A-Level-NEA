**AI-driven video doorbell and mobile app** designed to help home-workers avoid interruptions during video calls. Captures images of visitors, recognises familiar faces with computer vision, and allows the user to interact via a mobile app ‚Äì all without leaving their desk. 

Coursework project for **A Level Computer Science** awarded **97%**.

- **Software**: OpenCV (image processing), face_recognition (deep learning-based face recognition), Python Kivy (movile app frontend), Flask (mobile app backend)<br><br>


## üìù Project Overview

For my A Level Computer Science coursework, I wanted to create a project that was genuinely useful. During COVID, a family friend working from home mentioned that her video calls were frequently interrupted by visitors ringing the doorbell, making it difficult to stay focused and professional. I decided to solve this problem with an intelligent, AI-powered solution.  

Over several months, I designed, developed, tested, and refined a fully functional system **SmartBell**. Here is the final product of that hard work:

### What is SmartBell?

SmartBell is an AI-driven video doorbell and mobile app. At its core, a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera, speaker, and button captures an image of any visitor. If the visitor is familiar, the system recognises them using **deep learning-based face recognition** via the Python `face_recognition` library.  

The mobile app allows the user to interact with the doorbell in real-time. When the doorbell is rung, a notification appears on the user‚Äôs phone with a photo of the visitor and, where it is known, their name. The user can then play a pre-recorded audio message through the doorbell‚Äôs speaker without leaving their desk, for example, *‚ÄúCould you leave the shopping by the porch?‚Äù*. If the user is away, the app logs all visits, storing images and timestamps for easy review.


### Visitor Capture & Detection
- Button press triggers Raspberry Pi camera to capture visitor image  
- Detects faces using **OpenCV Haar cascades**  
- Sends notification to the user‚Äôs phone with visitor image and name (if recognised)  

### AI-Powered Face Recognition
- Computes **face encodings** for each detected face using `face_recognition`  
- Compares encodings against a stored database of known visitors  
- Identifies visitors in real-time and updates database with new faces for improved accuracy  

### Mobile App 
- Notifies user when the doorbell is rung and displays visitor image and name (if available)  
- Plays pre-recorded messages remotely via Raspberry Pi speaker  
- Logs visits when the user is unavailable  

### Cloud Logging & Notifications
- Stores visitor images and timestamps in a secure cloud database  
- Sends notifications even when the user is away from home  
- Provides an easy-to-review history of all visits<br><br>
